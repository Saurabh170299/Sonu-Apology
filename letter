  <h2>To My Rusleli Bolake,</h2>
  <p class="message">
    I know I messed up, and I can’t express enough how sorry I am for hurting you.  
    Not a moment goes by where I don’t regret what happened.  
    You didn’t deserve that pain, especially not from someone who claims to love you.

    <br><br>
    I realize now how important trust is — how it’s the foundation of everything we’ve built together.  
    And I took it for granted. That’s on me.  
    But I’m learning, slowly and painfully, what it truly means to love someone not just with words,  
    but with actions, with consistency, with respect.

    <br><br>
    You are more than just my girlfriend — you're my closest friend, my strength,  
    the person who makes life brighter.  
    When I say I miss you, I mean I miss your voice, your laugh,  
    the way you say “rusleli bolake” when I’m being silly, and even the way you scold me when I mess up.  
    I miss all of it. I miss *us*.

    <br><br>
    If you’re reading this, I just want you to know I’m not giving up.  
    I’m not perfect, but I’m ready to grow, to listen, to rebuild that trust — however long it takes.  
    You deserve that effort. You deserve someone who learns from their mistakes.  
    You deserve the very best version of me — and that’s what I promise to work toward.

    <br><br>
    I love you, Ankita.  
    More than I can put into a website or a letter.  
    Please, whenever you’re ready, I’m here — heart open, hands open, waiting.

    <br><br>
    Forever yours,  
    <br><strong>Sonu</strong>
